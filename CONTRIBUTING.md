# Contributing

Do you want to help people get started speaking at tech conferences? That's awesome! Here's how to help!

1. Make a pull request that adds your next availability option to README.md. You can do in-person spots in your area, schedule times when you'll be available on-line, or even just offer for folks to email you. (If it's an in-person event, try to give folks at least a week of advance notice.)

2. Promote your Speaker Jam in whatever way works best for you. Change this example:

> "If you want to start speaking at confs, I can help! Tonight 5-6pm in Cap Hill. Brainstorm topics, proposal review! https://github.com/KatieK2/speaker-jam"

3. Help people and keep being awesome!

# What Does This Mean?

Let potential speakers know that you're willing to share your knowledge of successful speaking by working with them to brainstorm ideas, write CFPs, and share "what worked for you" in the past. 

When someone reaches out for help, we'll connect them with the best person to help out.

Organize casual sessions in person or on-line with potential speakers. Jams are meant to be an informal kind of conversation; you don't have to do any or all of the below; but here are some ideas. 

## Idea Brainstorming

* Ask the prospective speakers how they started in development, and what inspirations and hurdles they had getting there.
* Ask them about what they're building right now. What have they built that their excited about?
* What conferences have they gone to? What were their favorite speakers and why?
* When you hear something interesting, mention that might be an interesting talk to hear!

## Conduct

All speaker jams must follow the Cascadia Fest code of conduct: https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/COC.md
