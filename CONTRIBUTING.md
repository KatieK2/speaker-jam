#Contributing

Do you want to help people get started speaking at tech conferences? That's awesome! Here's how to help!

1. Make a pull request that adds your next availability option to README.md. You can do in-person spots in your area, schedule times when you'll be available on-line, or even just offer for folks to email you. (If it's an in-person event, try to give folks around a week's worth of advance notice.)
1. Promote your Speaker Jam in whatever way works best for you. Change this example "If you want to start speaking at confs, I can help! Tonight 5-6pm in Cap Hill. Brainstorm topics, proposal review! https://github.com/KatieK2/speaker-jam"
1. Help people and keep being awesome!

#Jamming

Jams are meant to be an informal kind of conversation; you don't have to do any or all of the below; but here are some ideas. 

##Idea Brainstorming

* Ask the prospective speakers how they started in development, and what inspirations and hurdles they had getting there.
* Ask them about what they're building right now. What have they built that their excited about?
* What conferences have they gone to? What were their favorite speakers and why?
* When you hear something interesting, mention that might be an interesting talk to hear!

##Thank you!
